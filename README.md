# SortingsByTim
This is a repo containing code of my fun project to write a nuget for sorting algorithms. It's WIP, and I will document it a bit more once I am done.

Awesome planned features:
- DI
- Observability of each single step
- sync and async version
- Bogo Sort
- logging
- static use for cool console applications
